# Brain Tumor Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of brain tumor images using machine learning techniques. It includes Python code for training and evaluating brain tumor classification models. Additionally, a Jupyter Notebook is provided for demonstration purposes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Notebook**: [brain_tumor_classification_demo.ipynb](notebook/brain_tumor_classification_demo.ipynb) - This Jupyter Notebook provides a demonstration of the brain tumor classification process.

- **Python Files**:
    - [train.py](python/train.py) - Python script for training and testing brain tumor classification models on a high-performance cluster.
    
- **SLURM Logs**: The [slurm-xxxx.out] files are the output logs generated during model training runs on the high-performance cluster. These logs can be analyzed to gather performance metrics and create graphs.
